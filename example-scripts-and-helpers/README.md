# Example script folder

This folder contains legacy scripts and instructions for setting up 3bij3. Think of setting up crontab jobs, or some helper scripts to send reminders to participants.

These are sometimes quick&dirty hacks and either are already superseded by more generalizable functionality, or will be so in the future.
