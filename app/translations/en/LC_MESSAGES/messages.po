"Participating in the research will not entail your being subjected to any"

"societal issues. Then, we will ask you to follow a link to a news app we "
"developed. You do not have to download it, but you can use it in your "
"browser. We ask you to use this news app during the next two weeks. You "
"can use the app as often as you wish, but you need to [[TODO ADD SPECIFIC"
" REQUIREMENTS OF USAGE]]to recceive full compensation. The app will also "
"show you your progress. When you use the app, we will record your clicks "
"within the app. This means that we will know which articles in the app "
"you used, or if you used any other functionality of the app. We cannot "
"see anything else that you are doing in your browser. The clicks will not"
" be linked in any way to you as a person, and we will not be able to link"
" this information to your name, email, or similar. All data will be "
"processed in a secured environment at the University of Amsterdam. For "
"more information about the research you are welcome to contact the "
"project leader Damian Trilling, d.c.trilling@uva.nl, +31-627827904, "
